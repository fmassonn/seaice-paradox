# Our goal in this script is first to create an array called "forecasts" that will record several diagnostics out of the native
# sea ice data provided by ECMWF. The array will have the following dimensions:

# 1st dimension: the *d*iagnostic (e.g., extent, area of sea ice)
# 2nd dimension: the *r*egion (e.g., Arctic, Ross Sea, ...)     
# 3rd dimension: the *m*onth of initialization (e.g., Jan, Feb, ...)
# 4th dimension: the *y*ear of initialization (e.g., 1993, 1994, ...)
# 5th dimension: the mem*b*er (e.g., 1, 2, ...)
# 6th dimension: the *l*ead time (e.g., 1, 2, ...)

# Each dimension has a corresponding running index called j${letter} where $letter is d, r, m, y, b, l following the dimensions above. Each index runs from 0 to the length of the dimension (not included, as per Python conventions)
